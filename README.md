# Username-Logic

Small Script created with python that decides whether username and password is secure
enough (based on set parameters). Currently uses 2 while loops with embedded if/elif 
statements (one for username and one for password).  

# Future Implementations 
Will eventually add other parameters and if/elif statements soon to determine if illegal 
characters have been entered by the user.
